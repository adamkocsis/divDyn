# divDyn
R package for quantifying diversity dynamics using fossil sampling data (v0.6.1)

## News
- I uploaded the package to the CRAN servers, but it will likely take more than a week until you can use the regular package installing routines. The section 'Installing' below will guide you through the installation process in a different way. I will keep you posted when the binaries are accesible for the different architectures.

- The preprint describing the package is uploaded to bioRxiv. You can download it from here:
http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/423780v1
If you decide to use the methods implemented in this package, please refer to this document. The examples implemented in this manuscript are elaborated in this vignette:
https://github.com/adamkocsis/ddPhanero/blob/master/doc/0.3/dd_phanero.pdf




## About the package

If you are interested in what this package does, or have questions about its use, please check out the first vignette: 'Handout to the R package 'divDyn' v0.6.1 for diversity dynamics from fossil occurrence data' here:
https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/blob/master/_archive/vignettes/Handout_0.6.1.pdf

As the package is still getting developed, please note that some interface changes might occurr based on the feedback of people and my own experience on what is easier to use. If you have any requirements or recommendations about what to add (or more importantly, if you find a mistake), do not hesitate to contact me at adam.kocsis@fau.de.


## Installing 

### 1. Using the the binaries I have built

I have updated the windows binaries so that they work with the latest internals (3.5.1). If you want to use the package, please update your R.

- If you have a windows computer, you can install the package with the following R command:
  `install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_bin/Win_x64_x86/divDyn_0.6.1.zip", repos=NULL)`

- If you have a Mac, then use the following link (still older version, for R <3.5).
  `install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_bin/Mac_OSX/divDyn_0.5.2.tgz", repos=NULL)`
  I know this is old, but will update it at the earliest convenience (I do not have a Mac). Until I am done with this, please use install    method 2.

- If you have Linux computer you probably know how to solve these problems (go to 2.)

### 2. Using the source tarball to install
This you can do with running
```
install.packages(
  "https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_archive/source/divDyn_0.6.1.tar.gz", 
  repos=NULL, type="source")
```

from the R console. Note that there is some code in the package that requires compilation. For windows, the most straightforward way is to use Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), and XCode https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ for Mac.

The sources of the older versions are also in the _archive/source folder. You can access earlier versions by changing the version number in the command above in an appropriate way.

### 3. Using the repository files and devtools to install

To do this:
- You need a compiler, as for method 2
- Make sure that the 'devtools' package is installed
- Run `devtools::install_github("adamkocsis/divDyn")`

If you do not want to mess around with compiler and such, then contact me and I will find a way to compile binaries for you.


# Change log

## [0.6.1] - 2018.10.01
### Added
- the singletons() function to quickly return single-occurrence, single-reference, single-interval and similar taxa
- citation file

### Changed 
- typo correction in the 'stages' table: 'Ordiovician' entries in the 'period' column were corrected to 'Ordovician'
- minor changes in help files.

## [0.6.0] - 2018.09.17
### Added 
- the indices() function to calculate some basic diversity indices within the package. Please feel encouraged to use the rest from the 'vegan' package.
- the binstat() and sumstat() functions. Binstat calculates bin-specific indices and sampling metrics, sumstat() calculates those relevant for the entire occurrence database. Most functionality of the deprecated sampstat() function is in binstat. 
- forgotten proper cleanup of dynamic libraries upon package unload


## Changed
- material in the sampstat() function was reorganized to two separate functions, see above

## Deleted
- the deprecated crDD() function and the old plotTS() functions were deleted from the package


## [0.5.2] - 2018.09.02
### Added
- x argument for sampstat() to calculate maximum quotas with OxW subsampling.
- the "none" subsampling type to subsample(). This argument will skip the subsampling part, but reruns the *applied function* in the trials, nevertheless.

### Changed
- the map() function was renamed to categorize() to better reflect its intended use

## [0.5.1] - 2018.08.31
### Changed
- example bin identifier changes (from 'slc' to 'stg')
- the subsample(), subtrialCR(), subtrialOXW(), subtrialSQS() functions now automatically omit rows that have NA entries in the 'bin' variables.
- the 'stages' object now contains dates from Ogg et al. 2016
- bin durations were added to both the 'stages' and 'bins' objects
- the 'stratkeys' and 'keys' objects were updated to version 0.9.2

## [0.5.0-1] - 2018.08.29
### Changed
- stratigraphic assignment objects (in 'keys') now have a -1 entries for empty strings


## [0.5.0] - 2018.08.20
### Added
- bug fix that made R crash randomly
- subsampling trial functions (subtrialCR(), subtrialOXW(), subtrialSQS()) and cleaned help files for 'subsample()'

- proper Description in description file

### Changed
- the functions 'plotTS()' and 'fadLad()' were renamed to 'tsplot()' and 'fadlad()' for easier typing. 
- 'stratkeys' and the corresponding 'keys' updated to v0.9.1
- the 'sampstat()' function no longer outputs empty variables when the argument columns are set to NULL

### Deleted
- the 'exact' method implementation for SQS as it was slow and and incorrect. The 'inexact' method was confirmed with the iNEXT package.


## [0.4.2] - 2018.07.24
### Added
- the ranges() function to plot occurrence data and stratigraphic ranges over time (see examples)
- fadLad(): function defenses 
- fadLad(): two bin columns are now allowed as input (for age uncertainty estimation)

## [0.4.1] - 2018.07.07
### Added
- function defenses
- fixes to conform to the CRAN requirements

### Changed
- default settings for the sampstat() and subsample() functions to increase flexibility and user-friendliness
- the intact argument of subsample() was separated to the rem and keep arguments, to enable negative time-slice identifiers.

## [0.4.0] - 2018.06.29
### Added
- the first vignette is now included
- bug fix for the parts() function. Due to the overplotting of polygons, the RGBA colours were not appropriately visualized
- bug fix to the omit() function's binref method.
- the "total" method for the sampstat() function
- documentation to the built in datasets
- the map() function to resolve information downloaded from the PaleoDB
- 'keys' to the stratigraphic and environmental resolution, based on the FossilWorks dynamic timescale ?keys
- the 10 million year timescale of the Paleobiology Database, ?bin

### Changed
- The sampstat() function now outputs a data.frame, instead of a matrix.
- the 'method' argument of subsample() was renamed to 'type' to avoid problems with argument distribution with the frequent 'method' argument name

## [0.3.1] - 2018.06.04

## [0.2.11] - 2018.05.17
### Added
- bug fix for the plotTS() function, enables log scaling of y axis with plot.args=list(log="y")

- the omit() function for culling occurrence datasets (kind of slow yet)

### Changed
- argumentation of the divDyn function was extended to accomodate the omission of occurrences within the function (optional)


## [0.2.9] - 2018.05.09
### Changed
- the 'cr' method of the subsample() function was rewritten in C++ and with Rcpp classes for faster performance
- fixed bug in the subsample() function, when custom functions produce vector output

### Changes
- argument distribution in the subsample() function, FUN argument simplified to a single function

### Planned
- the subsampling routines will be remodularized so that their argument becomes the dataset, rather than the individual columns. This will allow the support for custom subsampling functions.
- 

## [0.2.7] - 2018.02.01
### Changes
- bug (due to output changes in fadLad) and speed fixes for the affinity() function. The interface also changed, it now outputs a single vector instead of a data.frame.
