# divDyn
R package for analyzing diversity dynamics from fossil occurrence data

The vignette is getting written. Until then, the features of the package are demonstrated with the function examples (check out ?divDyn, ?subsample and ?affinity).  

As the package is still getting developed, if you have any requirements or recommendations on what to add (or if you find a mistake), please contact me at adam.kocsis@fau.de.


## Installing and update
As the package now uses compiled code to make things run faster, there are two ways to install.
1. The first option is to use the binaries I have built. 

If you have a windows computer, you can install the package with the following R command:
`install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_bin/Win_x64_x86/divDyn_0.3.1.zip", repos=NULL)`

If you have a Mac running OS X, then use the following link:
`install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_bin/Mac_OSX/divDyn_0.3.1.tgz", repos=NULL)`

If you have Linux computer you probably know how to solve these problems. The sources of different versions are in the /_archive folder. Otherwise you can try option no. 2. 

You can access earlier versions by changing the version number appropriately.

2. The second option is to compile the code for yourself. To do this:
- Install a compiler. For Windows, this would be included in Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- Make sure that the 'devtools' package is installed
- Run `devtools::install_github("adamkocsis/divDyn")`

 '*' if you use either a Mac or Linux, and point no. 2 doesn't work for you for some reason, then contact me  and I will compile a binary for you.

# Change log
## [0.3.1] - 2018.06.04
### Added
- method argument for the affinity() function, allows implementation of a simple majority rule (method="majority") or the Bayesian approach of Simpson and Harnik (2009, method="bayesian")

### Changed
- the affinity() function was also completely reprogrammed

## [0.3.0] - 2018.06.01
### Added
- continuous time entry is now possible for the divDyn() function. (does not yet work with subsampling!!!!)
- the breaks argument to the divDyn() function

### Changed
- the examples and defaults match the current download from the Paleobiology Database
- the previous 'scleractinia' example dataset was renamed to 'corals' for the sake of simplicity

## [0.2.12] - 2018.05.17
### Added
- na.rm argument for the shades() function to omit gaps in plotting of the time series
- bug fix for the shades() function, single rows bounded by rows of NAs (gaps) from above and below do not crash the function anymore


## [0.2.11] - 2018.05.17
### Added
- bug fix for the plotTS() function, enables log scaling of y axis with plot.args=list(log="y")
- the parts() function for efficient plotting of proportion/count data over time 


## [0.2.10] - 2018.05.13
### Added
- proportional extinction and origination rates to the divDyn() function
- the omit() function for culling occurrence datasets (kind of slow yet)

### Changed
- argumentation of the divDyn function was extended to accomodate the omission of occurrences within the function (optional)


## [0.2.9] - 2018.05.09
### Changed
- the 'cr' method of the subsample() function was rewritten in C++ and with Rcpp classes for faster performance
- fixed bug in the subsample() function, when custom functions produce vector output


## [0.2.8] - 2018.05.01
### Added
- multiple versions of the shareholder quorum subsampling (SQS) routine to subsample()
- the sampstat() function, that outputs basic sampling stats for the time slices
- useFailed argument to subsample(). Changes output depending on whether the subsampling quota/quorum is reached.
- bug fix for the CR method in subsampling 

### Changes
- argument distribution in the subsample() function, FUN argument simplified to a single function

### Planned
- the subsampling routines will be remodularized so that their argument becomes the dataset, rather than the individual columns. This will allow the support for custom subsampling functions.
- 

## [0.2.7] - 2018.02.01
### Changes
- bug (due to output changes in fadLad) and speed fixes for the affinity() function. The interface also changed, it now outputs a single vector instead of a data.frame.
- bug fix in the ratesplit() function argument distribution. The "combine" version works properly now.

# Change log
## [0.2.6] - 2018.01.26
### Added
- John Alroy's (2015) second-for-third extinction/origination proportions/rates to the divDyn() function

## [0.2.5] - 2018.01.22
### Added
- survivors() function to calculate survivorship probabilities

### Changes
- the 'subseries()' function was renamed to 'subsample()' for easier application
- the 'fadLad()' function was redrafted for speed

## [0.2.4] - 2018.01.15
### Added
- the the "oxw" method for the subseries() function. This implements occurrence-weighted by list subsampling.

## [0.2.3] - 2018.01.08
### Added
- the subseries() function to execute certain functions with subsampling applied.


## [0.2.2] - 2017.12.18
### Added
- the shades() function for plotting distributions of values arranged in a time series

## [0.2.1] - 2017.12.12
### Added
- the ratesplit() function for selectivity tests
- period abbreviations for the 'stages' object

### Changes
- plotTS() function default changes


## [0.2.0] - 2017.12.11
