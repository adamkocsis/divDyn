# divDyn
R package for analysing diversity dynamics with Paleobiology Database occurrences

## installing and update
As the package now uses compiled code to make things run faster, there are two ways to install.
A. I have built binaries for Windows x86 and x64. If you have one of these architectures, you can install the package with:
install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/divDyn/raw/master/_bin/divDyn_0.2.0.zip")

B. You have to compile the code for yourself. For this:
1. install a compiler. for windows this would be included in Rtools.
2. make sure that the devtools package is installed
3. run devtools::install_github("adamkocsis/divDyn")
