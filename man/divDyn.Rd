\title{Time series from metrics of diversity dynamics}
\usage{
divDyn(dat, tax = "occurrence.genus_name", bin = "bin", noNAStart = F,
  inf = F, data.frame = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{(data.frame): the data frame containing PBDB occurrences.}

\item{tax}{(char): variable  name of the occurring taxa (variable type: factor) - such as "occurrence.genus_name"}

\item{bin}{(char): variable name of the time slice numbers of the particular occurrences (variable type: int)- such as "slc" or whatever. Bin numbers should be in ascending order,can contain NA's, it can start from a number other than 1 and must not start with 0.}

\item{noNAStart}{(bool): useful when the dataset does not start from bin No. 1. Then noNAStart=TRUE will cut the first part of the resulting table, 
so the first row will contain the estimates for the lowest bin number.}

\item{inf}{(logical): should infinites be converted to NAs?}

\item{data.frame}{(logical): should be a data frame or a matrix?}
}
\description{
This function calculates 
various metrics in the form of time series from resolved PBDB occurrences.
}
\details{
The following variables are produced:

bin: the time slice number

tThrough: the number of through-ranging taxa

tOri: the number of originating taxa

tExt: the number of taxa getting extinct

tSing: the number of stratigraphic singleton (single-interval) taxa

t2d: the number of taxa that are present in the i-1th and the ith interval (lower two timers)

t2u: the number of taxa that are present in the ith and the i+1th interval (upper two timers)

tGFu: upper gap-fillers ($later)

tGFd: lower gap-fillers ($later)

t3: the number of three timer taxa, present in time slice i-1, i, and i+1

tPart: the part timer taxa, present in time slice i-1,and i+1, but not in i

extPC: the per capita extinction rates of foote (not normalized with interval length!)

oriPC: the per capita origination rates of foote (not normalized with interval length!)

ext3t: the three-timer extinction rates

ori3t: the three-timer origination rates

extC3t: the corrected three-timer extinction rates

oriC3t: the corrected three-timer origination rates

divSIB: sampled-in-bin diversity (richness)

divCSIB: corrected sampled-in-bin diversity (richness)

divBC: boundary-crosser diversity (richness)

divRT: range-through diversity (richness)

sampRange: sampling probability (Foote)

samp3t: three-timer sampling completeness (used as a correcting value in nC3tExt, nC3tOri and nCorrSIB)

extGF: gap-filler extinction rates

oriGF: gap-filler origination rates
