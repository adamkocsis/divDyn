\title{Basic sampling summary for every bin}
\usage{
sampstat(dat, tax = "genus", bin = "stg", coll = NULL, ref = NULL,
  total = FALSE, noNAStart = FALSE, duplicates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{\code{(data.frame)}: The occurrence dataset.}

\item{tax}{\code{(character)}: The column name of taxon names.}

\item{bin}{\code{(character)}: The column name of bin names.}

\item{coll}{\code{(character)}: The column name of collection numbers. (optional)}

\item{ref}{\code{(character)}: The column name of reference numbers. (optional)}

\item{total}{\code{(logical)}:  If \code{FALSE}, then the function will provide sampling statistics for the individual bins. \code{TRUE} on the other hand, will provide them for the total dataset.}

\item{noNAStart}{(logical) Useful when the dataset does not start from bin no. 1, but positive integer bin numbers are provided. Then \code{noNAStart=TRUE} will cut the first part of the resulting table, so the first row will contain the estimates for the lowest bin number. In case of positive integer bin identifiers, and if \code{noNAStart=FALSE}, the index of the row will be the bin number.}

\item{duplicates}{\code{(logical)}: The function will check whether there are duplicate occurrences (multiple species/genera). When set to \code{NULL}, nothing will happen, but the function will notify you if duplicates are present. If set to \code{TRUE}, the function will not do anything with these, if set to \code{FALSE}, the duplicates will be omitted.}

\description{
This function will return the basic sampling summaries of a dataset
}
\details{
A number of sampling related variables are calculated with the function.

By setting \code{total} to \code{FALSE} (default), the following results are output:

\code{occs}: The number of occurrences in each time bin.

\code{colls}: The number of collections in each time bin.

\code{refs}: The number of references in each time bin.

\code{SIBs}: The number of Sampled-In-Bin taxa in each time bin.

\code{occ1}: The number of taxa in each time bin, that occur in only 1 collection.

\code{ref1}: The number of taxa in each time bin, that occur in only 1 reference.

\code{occ2}: The number of taxa in each time bin, that occur in exactly 2 collections.

\code{ref2}: The number of taxa in each time bin, that occur in exactly 2 references.

\code{dom}: Dominance, the proportion of occurrences in the time bin that belong to the most frequent taxon.

\code{u}: Good's u, coverage estimator based on the number of single-collection taxa (occ1).

\code{uPrime}: Good's u, coverage estimator based on the number of single-reference taxa (ref1).

\code{chao1occ}: Chao1 extrapolation estimator, based on the the number of single-collection and two-collection taxa (occ1).

\code{chao1ref}: Chao1 extrapolation estimator, based on the the number of single-reference and two-reference taxa (occ2).

Setting the \code{total} to \code{TRUE} will lead to the following results

\code{bins}: The total number of bins sampled.

\code{occs}: The total number of sampled occurrences.

\code{colls}: The total number of sampled collections.

\code{refs}:  The total number of sampled references.

\code{taxa}:  The total number of sampled taxa.

\code{gappiness}: The proportion of sampling gaps in the ranges of the taxa ยง.
